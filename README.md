Roku-Retaliate-Channel
======================
This is the open source version of Retaliate. I created a seperate repository because the official repository is private and contains sensitive data.

You may only use Retaliate source code to publish free private channels. Using this base code to release a free/non-free public Roku channel or a non-free private Roku channel is prohibited. You may however keep and use the donate button on your private channel, in case people would like to donate towards your modded version of Retaliate. 

Cheers and enjoy!
